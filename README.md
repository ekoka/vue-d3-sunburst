### A D3.js Zoombable Sunburst as a Vue.js Component

This is a D3.js re-implementation of the Zoomable Sunburst chart inspired by Mike Bostock's notebook at [https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-sunburst](https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-sunburst).

The code in the component is organized to emphasize clarity. It is also heavily commentted to explain what is being done and why. My hope is that it makes it a bit more scrutable for anyone deciding to reuse and customize it.
